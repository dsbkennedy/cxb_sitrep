```

## Testing - week `r LastWeek` & `r ThisWeek`

-   This week (week `r ThisWeek`), **`r camp_test_fortnight %>% filter(week==ThisWeek) %>%  pull(total_tests)`** samples were tested. Last week (week `r LastWeek`), **`r camp_test_fortnight %>% filter(week==LastWeek) %>%  pull(total_tests)`** samples were tested.

-   This week (week `r ThisWeek`), **`r camp_test_fortnight %>% filter(week==ThisWeek) %>%  pull(positivity)`** of samples were positive for COVID-19. Last week (week `r LastWeek`), **`r camp_test_fortnight %>% filter(week==LastWeek) %>%  pull(positivity)`** of samples were positive for COVID-19.

# Descriptive epidemiology - FDMN/Rohingya refugee cases

-   The first test in the FDMN/Rohingya population was on `r first_test_fdmn_day_month` (Week `r first_test_fdmn_week`).
-   The first confirmed case in the FDMN/Rohingya population was on `r first_case_fdmn_day_month` (Week `r first_case_fdmn_week`).

## Age and sex breakdown
